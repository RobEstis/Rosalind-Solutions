# Rosalind-Solutions

🧬 Rosalind Bioinformatics Solutions (Python)

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the Rosalind Bioinformatics Platform (https://rosalind.info/
), implemented in Python.

Rosalind is a problem-solving platform designed to teach computational biology and bioinformatics through hands-on coding challenges. The problems range from fundamental string manipulation and probability concepts to more advanced topics such as dynamic programming, graph theory, and sequence alignment.

📌 Purpose of This Repository

This project serves several goals:

Strengthen Python programming fundamentals

Build computational biology problem-solving skills

Develop algorithmic thinking

Create a structured bioinformatics coding portfolio

Document learning progress through increasingly complex problems

This repository reflects consistent practice in solving algorithmic biology problems in a clean, reproducible, and well-documented way.
